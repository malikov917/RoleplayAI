        self.openai_ready = True  # âœ… ACTIVE
    
    async def _generate_openai_response(self, situation, history):
        # Real GPT API calls with sophisticated context building
        messages = self._build_conversation_context(situation, history)
        response = await self.client.chat.completions.create(...)
        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Enhanced Feedback Generation
```python
class FeedbackService:
    async def _generate_ai_feedback(self, session_data):
        # AI-powered conversation analysis
        transcript = self._build_transcript(session_data)
        feedback_prompt = f"""As an expert communication coach, 
                            analyze this roleplay conversation..."""
        # Returns structured feedback with scores and insights
```
